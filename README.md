Hi, I'm a full-time game programmer.

In 2023, I interned at Unity China and published my game production experience at the Unity Open Day Beijing Station.

The game "Evolution Contract" developed by myself in 2023 won the 2023 Eagle Point Pioneer Core "Innovative Game Design Award" and was shortlisted for the "Best Game Design Award" and "Best Strategy Game Award" of the 3rd CUSGA National College Student Game Development Competition.

Currently working in a large game company using Unreal 5 for GamePlay development. In my spare time, I like to play with Unity and combine various technologies into game development.
